// The provided code has a syntax error because the final keyword is used in the
// declaration of the display() method in the Student class, but there is no
// method body (implementation) provided for the display() method. When a method
// is declared as final, it means the method cannot be overridden by subclasses,
// but it still needs to have a valid implementation.
